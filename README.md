# PDF-Chatbot
Creating a GitHub repository for your PDF Chatbot project and providing clear instructions for setup is a great way to share your work with others. Here's how you can structure your GitHub repository:

1. **Create a New GitHub Repository**:

   Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your PDF Chatbot project. You can choose to make it public or private, depending on your preference.

2. **Repository Structure**:

   Organize your GitHub repository as follows:

   ```
   /pdf-chatbot
     ├── app.py
     ├── requirements.txt
     ├── README.md
     ├── /static
     │    └── (Place any static files here)
     ├── /templates
     │    └── (Place any HTML templates here)
   ```

   - `app.py`: Your main application script.
   - `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.
   - `README.md`: Documentation for your project, including setup instructions.
   - `/static`: A directory for static assets (e.g., images, stylesheets).
   - `/templates`: A directory for HTML templates (if using a web framework like Flask).

3. **Write the README.md**:

   In your `README.md` file, provide detailed instructions for setting up and running the PDF Chatbot:

   ```markdown
   # PDF Chatbot

      cd pdf-chatbot
      ```

   3. Install the required libraries using pip:

      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

      python app.py
      ```

   2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.
