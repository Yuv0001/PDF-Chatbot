Note:- You can find the model I used, "bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad," on the Hugging Face Model Hub. Here's the link to the model's documentation: https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html#bertforquestionanswering
This documentation provides information about the model, its capabilities, and how to use it for question-answering tasks.

For more information about the Hugging Face Transformers library and other pre-trained models, you can visit the Hugging Face Model Hub: https://huggingface.co/models

You can explore various NLP models and find the one that best fits your needs for your PDF chat app or other natural language processing tasks
